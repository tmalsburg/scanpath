#' Given a set of scanpaths, this function calculates the similarities
#' between all pairs of scanpaths in the set.
#'
#' @title Calculate pair-wise similarities among a set of scanpaths
#' @param data is a data frame containing the eye movement data.  Each
#' line represents one fixation of the eyes.  The fixations of a trial
#' have to be listed en bloc and in chronological order.  Required
#' columns are: trial ID (unique in the whole data set), x- and y-
#' coordinate of fixations, and the fixation durations.  See the
#' example data set provided with this package.
#' @param formula specifies which columns in the given data frame are
#' relevant.  The left-hand side specifies the column that contains
#' the fixation duration The right-hand side consist of terms that
#' specify x- and y-coordinate of the fixations (in that order)
#' conditioned on trial IDs.  See examples below.
#' @param center_x is the x-coordinate of the point that is targeted
#' when the eye looks straight ahead (usually the center of the
#' screen).
#' @param center_y is the y-coordinate of the point that is targeted
#' when the eye looks straight ahead (usually the center of the
#' screen).
#' @param viewing_distance is the distance of the eyes to the
#' screen.
#' @param unit_size is ratio of one unit of the coordinate system and
#' the unit in which the viewing distance was given.  So, one unit in
#' the coordinate system is \code{unit_size * unit of
#' distance}.  Example: If the coordinates are pixels on a screen with
#' 60 dpi and the unit of the distance is inches, \code{unit_size} has
#' to be set to 1/60.
#' @param modulator specifies how spatial distances between fixations
#' are assessed.  When set to 0, any spatial divergence of two
#' compared scanpaths is penalized independently of its degree.  When
#' set to 1, the scanpaths are compared only with respect to their
#' temporal patterns.  The default value approximates the sensitivity
#' to spatial distance found in the human visual system.
#' @param data2 optionally provides a second set of scanpaths.  In
#' this case \code{scasim} computes the distances from each scanpath
#' in the first set to each scanpath in the second set.  The resulting
#' matrix of distances is therefore not necessarily square.
#' @param formula2 specifies the relevant columns in \code{data2} in
#' case they are named differently in \code{data2} than in
#' \code{data}.  \code{formula2} defaults to \code{formula}.
#' @param normalize specifies how each calculated similarity value for
#' scanpaths s and t should be normalized.  There are three possible
#' modes:
#' 
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{fixations}}{normalize by dividing by the total number
#'   of fixations in s and t,}
#'   \item{\code{durations}}{divide by the total duration of s and t,}
#'   \item{\code{FALSE}}{don't normalize at all.}
#' }
#' 
#' The choice of normalization mode can have a strong effect when
#' fitting maps of scanpaths using \code{\link[MASS]{isoMDS}} or
#' \code{\link{cmdscale}}.  Not normalizing at all can yield maps that
#' are difficult to interpret when scanpaths differ markedly in their
#' duration or number of fixations.
#' @details When using \code{scasim}, the dissimilarity of two
#' scanpaths is assessed based on the distances of their fixation
#' targets.  If the distances are really small, the dissimilarity will
#' mostly be a function of just the differences of the fixation
#' durations.  The evaluation of distance accounts for the particular
#' way the human visual system magnifies the center of the visual
#' field and the drop in acuity at its periphery.
#' @return A matrix containing the pair-wise dissimilarities.  Columns
#' and rows correspond to trials.  Their order is the same as the
#' order of trials in \code{data}.

#'
#' @title Calculate the similarity of two scanpaths

#'   provided with this package.
#' @param t is the second scanpath.  Same format as for s.
#' @param formula specifies which columns in the given data frame are
#'   should be used.  The left-hand side specifies the column that
#'   contains the fixation duration.  The right-hand side consist of
#'   terms that specify x- and y-coordinate of the fixations (in that
#'   order).  See examples below.
#' @param center_x is the x-coordinate of the point that is targeted
#'   when the eye looks straight ahead (usually the center of the
#'   screen).
#' @param center_y is the y-coordinate of the point that is targeted
#'   when the eye looks straight ahead (usually the center of the
#'   screen).
#' @param viewing_distance is the distance of the eyes from the screen
#'   in some arbitrary unit.
#' @param unit_size the ratio of one unit of the coordinate system to
#'   one of the units in which the viewing distance was
#'   given.  Example: If the coordinates are pixels on a screen with
#'   60 dpi and the unit of the distance is inches, \code{unit_size}
#'   has to be set to 1/60.
#' @param modulator specifies how spatial distances between fixations
#'   are assessed.  When set to 0, any spatial divergence of two
#'   compared fixations is penalized independently equally
#'   strong.  When set to 1, the scanpaths are compared only with

#'   were aligned.  Columns \code{s} and \code{t} contain the indices
#'   of the fixations in scanpaths s and t, and the column ~cost~ the
#'   cost of the edit operation.  The sum of the costs is the total
#'   dissimilarity of s and t.  If either \code{s} or \code{t} contain

#' order to simulate different reading speeds, the recorded fixation
#' durations were modified by adding additional time that was sampled
#' from a normal distribution with different means for each subject.

#'   \item{\code{trial}}{the id of the trial}
#'   \item{\code{word}}{the word that was targeted by the fixation}

#'   \item{\code{y}}{the y coordinate of a fixation in pixels}
#'   \item{\code{duration}}{the duration of a fixation in milliseconds}}
